Mansi froze with fear. His claws were all around her. The fingers bristled her hair and each strand shivered with anxiety. She hoped that someone would protect her and stop him but in this moment, she was alone. Her eyes kept getting wider and she chided herself for the words that had led to this, the words she had uttered in complete nonchalance.

He was about to engulf her in his forced embrace, removing every trace of her identity, in the same way as darkness engulfs any sense of humaneness in the society. Mansi prepared for oblivion in her mind. His limbs stretched and then he paused. Something flashed in his mind. Mansi could see his brain processing like a computer, doing data analysis of some sort. "Was he even human?" Mansi thought with her breath stuck in her lungs and her voice in her throat.

Something clicked in his mind and suddenly, his limbs were moving towards Mansi's cheeks. The claws scraped the skin and moved around the face slowly. Mansi could feel the cold nails but her body had betrayed her and remained motionless.

It went on for eternity in Mansi's mind before he moved away his claws. Instead of removing her identity, he decided to forever etch his identity on hers.
