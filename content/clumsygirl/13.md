Mansi hit her head with a stick.

"Ouch! Damn!" She screamed with pain.

"Why won't you get out?" Mansi said with annoyance woven in each word. She kept pacing in her room holding her head in her hands and rubbing the spot where she had hit herself.

"Damn this song. Why can't it leave me alone?" Mansi said again as the song went on a loop in her mind.

"What should I do? What should I do?"

Mansi repeated along with the song.

"I wish there was some way I could give this problem to someone else," Mansi said and suddenly an idea popped in her head. Her eyes lit up. She picked her phone and opened the recording app.

And she started to sing. In a perfect pitch, with her soul in it, she recorded the song.

"Not the best quality but it should do," Mansi said listening to her rendition of the song. She shared the song with her friend.

'In love with this sing. So decided to sing it myself üòù'  
'After quite long'

Soon enough, a reply came.

'Wow!' and felt a huge weight lifted off her mind.

A couple of days later she got another message from her friend.

'Listening to your version of the song on loop. It's stuck in my head now. :('

She had almost forgotten the song now. She had successfully transferred the earworm to someone else.

Mansi smiled.
