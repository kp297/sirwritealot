Mansi slapped him harder than she had intended.

"I'm sorry," she said as he rubbed his cheek.

"Why did you hit me?" He asked.

"Why are you this weak?" She replied.

"I'm not weak." He mumbled.

"Yeah, right. I slapped you a little and you crumpled like a pack of cards hit by a crazy cat."

"That's vivid. I guess you are getting your Instagram cat fix," he said grinning.

"Not by choice. I'm being sent cat pics to see."

"Ahh. She?"

"Yes, she. And don't talk about her like you know her," Mansi said with a stern look on her face.

"Don't I?"

"No. She's my friend and not yours."

"Okay. But I won't mind knowing her," he said and winked at Mansi. Mansi fumed. Before she knew, her finger was pointing towards him.

"Stay away from her."

"What if she doesn't want to stay away from me," he said with a twinkle in his eyes and a smirk.

Mansi looked at him and knew he was joking. His left hand was still rubbing his cheek. Mansi knew what she had to do and slammed her fist in his stomach.

"Ouch! What was that for?"

"The slap was clearly not enough," Mansi said and grinned.
