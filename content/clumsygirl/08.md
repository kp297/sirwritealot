Mansi decided that life isn't worth living. She had shouted, screamed and cried but nothing could change the inevitable. She hadn't slept properly for days and she had even forgotten all her relationships because of this and yet, she hadn't found success.

"You shouldn't talk like this with them."

"Can you believe them? I'm trying to pay them to book the rooms. I literally want to pay them money and they aren't ready to take it. Morons!" Mansi roared.

"Don't worry. It's a corporation. They will find a way to take our money."

"Yeah. Let's hope we aren't sleeping on the streets when we reach Rome," Mansi said and tried to pay through the website again.
